# In this exercise we try out f-string function which we used in last program without knowing.
# that's a mistake of mine. No problem !! we will use this function here again.

print("here, I will talk about my mom's weight and hight.")
Height = 165 # centimeter
Weight = 80 # kilogram

Change_Height = Height / 100 # in meter
Change_Weight = Weight * 2.2 # in LB

print(f"First we have Height {Height} in centimeter and weight {Weight} in kilogram.")
print(f"Then we changed the value of height {Change_Height} in meter and weight {Change_Weight} in LBs")
