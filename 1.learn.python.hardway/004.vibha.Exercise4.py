# In this exercise we will give value to some veriables and do some math afterword with the help of veriables.
movie_halls = 100
halls_capacity = 300
customer = 200
ticket_booked = customer
ticket_not_booked = halls_capacity - customer
market_capacity = movie_halls * customer

print(f"There are{movie_halls} halls in this market.")
print(f"There are {ticket_booked} booked in each movie_halls.")
