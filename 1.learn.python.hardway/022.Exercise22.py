# we will revise all the functions which we used in the programs
# And will make a list of them to differnciate which i understand well and which i don't.
# This process take time. So, let's start it without any further delay.
# !!!!! Fighting !!!!!

            If we want to add variable in a string then we use format string.
            for this we use 'f' before double-quote started and put {} bracket in the string
            and give variable in this bracket."""
