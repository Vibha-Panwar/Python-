Description:
    creating this reposatory, for practising my python programing skill on daily basis.
    testing to check if i know how to commit and push on github.
    i am doing my homework now.
    but i got stuck here.
    i am asking about it to my brother.
    i think i did it accidentally.
    I am doing it again.
    I am trying it again to make sure that i woun't forget the process.
    it is a next day (saturday)
    i am again repeating the process.
    i hope i will not make any mistake today.
