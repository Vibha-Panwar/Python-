# Defining Simple Function :-->
#  We define a function with the word "def". After this give the name of the function.
# After name add parentheses and in the parentheses, give the list of the parameters.
# closed parentheses is followed by a colon ":".Then the body of the function is indented to the right.
# The depth of indentation does not matter but it must be the same for all the lines of the function.
# When we stop the indentation and start a new expression on the first column, thatâ€™s what tells Python that the function defintion has ended.

def add(x, y):
    z= x + y
    return z
a = add(10, 2)
print(a)
q = add(23, 4)
print(q)
